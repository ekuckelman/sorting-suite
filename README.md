# Sorting Suite
  * The purpose of this project was to strengthen our algorithmic thinking.
## Project Specs
  * Implement four fundamental sorting algorithms.
    * Bubble sort
    * Insertion sort
    * Merge sort
    * Quick sort
    
  * Stress test the sorting algorithms created
    * Create a function to generate large arrays of random numbers.
      * Sort those large arrays of random numbers.
    * Tests should demonstrate the differing efficiencies of each sort. 
      * Example: MergeSort will be able to handle much larger arrays than bubbleSort.
    * Test how large of an array you can consistently sort before the tests time out.
